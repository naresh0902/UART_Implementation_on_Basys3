# UART_Implementation_on_Basys3
This project implements a UART-based communication system on the **Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA** board. When connected to a PC via USB-UART and interfaced with a terminal (e.g., PuTTY),
characters typed into the terminal are received by the FPGA, processed, and echoed back. LEDs and the 7-segment display give real-time feedback.

## ⚙️ How the System Works

### 1. UART Communication Flow

- **Transmitting from PC (via PuTTY)**: Characters typed are sent over USB-UART.
- **UART RX Module** receives serial data and converts it to 8-bit parallel form.
- **UART TX Module** transmits 8-bit parallel data back as serial.
- **Button (`btnL`)** is used to trigger both UART **read** and **write** operations.
- **Debouncer** ensures clean button signal.
- **LEDs** display received ASCII code.
- **7-Segment Display** lights up if UART RX FIFO is full or empty.

### 2. Data Processing

- The top-level module includes the line:  assign rec_data1 = rec_data + 1.


-This increments the received ASCII code by 1 before sending it back.

-Input: a (ASCII 97) → FPGA sends back: b (ASCII 98)

-To echo exact characters, replace with:
assign rec_data1 = rec_data;

##🛠️ Implementation on Basys 3
✅ Requirements
Vivado (tested with Vivado 2020.2+)

Digilent Basys 3 board

USB cable

Serial terminal software (e.g., PuTTY)

🔧 Steps
Open Vivado and create a new project.

Add Source Files:

All .v files from src/

Add Constraints:

Use the .xdc file from constraints/basys3_uart.xdc

Set Top Module:

uart_test.v

Synthesize → Implement → Generate Bitstream

Program Device with the .bit file.

##🧪 Testing Instructions
Connect Basys 3 via USB.

Open Device Manager → Ports (COM & LPT):

Note which COM port Basys 3 is using.

Open PuTTY:

Select "Serial"

Baud rate: 9600

Data bits: 8

Stop bits: 1

Parity: None

Flow Control: None

Start Session and type characters.

Press btnL (left button on Basys 3) to trigger UART read/write.

Observe:

LED pattern matches received ASCII code.

7-segment display lights based on FIFO status.

Received characters are echoed back with incremented ASCII.
